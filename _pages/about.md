I am a machine learning researcher at [Merantix Momentum](https://merantix-momentum.com/).
I am passionate about finding ways to apply advances in machine learning to real-world problems.

My main interests include Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), especially in combination with physics problems and interpretable ML on tabular data.
