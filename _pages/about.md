I am a PhD student in the group of [Stefan Chmiela](https://www.bifold.berlin/research/workgroups/view/workgroups-detail/machine-learning-for-molecular-simulation-in-quantum-chemistry) and a member of the BIFOLD grad school. I am passionate about finding ways to apply advances in machine learning to problems in the natural sciences. Before, I was a full-time machine learning researcher at [Merantix Momentum](https://merantix-momentum.com/) working on Graph Neural Networks and interpretability.
